# streamlit-copilot
Iteratively build a streamlit app using a copilot on the terminal.

Explores the concept of a copilot with complete control over code and runtime, unlike Github's copilot.

Streamlit does auto-refresh, so you can see changes happen live (cool!).

Things it can do:
- Connect to a database
- Load data by querying the database
- Transform your data
- Display the data as a:
    - Table
    - Line chart
    - Any other Streamlit graph
